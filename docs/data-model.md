# Data Model & Dataset Documentation

> This document describes the three data files used by CashGuardian CLI,
> their schema, contents, and the public datasets used to validate them.

---

## The Business: Mehta Wholesale Traders

A fictional wholesale goods distributor based in Punjab, India.
The dataset covers **90 days of financial activity** (January–April 2026).

This is a **synthetic dataset** — purpose-built for this project.
It was validated for realism against three public datasets (see bottom of this document).

---

## `data/transactions.json`

All income and expense transactions for the last 90 days.

### Schema

| `date` | string | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `type` | `"income"` \| `"expense"` | Direction of cash flow |
| `amount` | number | Indian Rupees (₹), always positive |
| `category` | string | See categories below |
| `description` | string | Human-readable label |
| `client` | string \| null | Client name for income; `null` for expenses |

### Income categories

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| `sales` | Product sales to wholesale clients |
| `consulting` | Advisory or consulting fees |
| `refund` | GST refunds or returns received |

### Expense categories

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| `salaries` | Monthly staff payroll |
| `rent` | Office and warehouse rent |
| `logistics` | Courier, delivery, and freight charges |
| `utilities` | Electricity, internet, phone |
| `marketing` | Digital ads and promotions |
| `miscellaneous` | Office supplies and sundry |

### Ground truth figures

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total records | 51 |
| Total income | ₹9,25,500 |
| Total expenses | ₹9,38,000 |
| **Net balance** | **₹−12,500** |
| Top expense: salaries | ₹3,60,000 (38%) |
| Second: logistics | ₹3,18,000 (34%) |
| Third: rent | ₹1,80,000 (19%) |
| Fourth: marketing | ₹37,500 (4%) |
| Fifth: utilities | ₹33,500 (4%) |
| Sixth: miscellaneous | ₹9,000 (1%) |

### Deliberate anomalies (for anomaly detection testing)

| Anomaly | Week | Actual | Expected avg | Deviation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logistics cost spike | 2026-W08 | ₹36,000 | ~₹21,000 | +72% → severity `high` |
| Revenue/sales spike | 2026-W10 | ₹1,05,000 | ~₹64,000 | +64% → severity `medium` |

## `data/invoices.json`

All client invoices raised by Mehta Wholesale Traders.

### Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique ID — format `INV001` |
| `client` | string | Client business name |
| `amount` | number | Invoice value in ₹ |
| `issueDate` | string | `YYYY-MM-DD` — date invoice was raised |

| `status` | `"paid"` \| `"unpaid"` \| `"overdue"` | Current status |
| `paymentHistory` | string[] | ISO dates of payments received (empty if unpaid) |

### Status definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `paid` | Settled — check `paymentHistory[0]` vs `dueDate` for lateness |
| `unpaid` | Not yet due — upcoming invoice |
| `overdue` | Past `dueDate` with no payment |

### Late payment detection

An invoice counts as **late** if: `paymentHistory[0] > dueDate`

### Invoice breakdown

| Status | Count | Total Value |
|---|---|---|
| Paid on time | 8 | — |
| Paid late | 5 | — |
| **Overdue** | **4** | **₹2,15,500** |
| Upcoming (unpaid) | 3 | ₹1,81,000 |

### Overdue invoice detail

| Client | Invoice | Amount | Days Overdue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sharma Retail | INV014 | ₹96,000 | 20 days |
| Gupta Enterprises | INV015 | ₹54,000 | 14 days |
| Patel Distributors | INV016 | ₹38,500 | 8 days |
| Verma & Sons | INV017 | ₹27,000 | 4 days |

### Client risk profile

| Client | Late Payments | Current Overdue | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sharma Retail** | 3 of 4 | ₹96,000 | **HIGH** |
| Patel Distributors | 1 of 3 | ₹38,500 | MEDIUM |
| Gupta Enterprises | 0 of 3 | ₹54,000 | MEDIUM |
| Verma & Sons | 0 of 3 | ₹27,000 | LOW-MEDIUM |
| Kapoor Traders | 0 of 3 | None | LOW |

| `weekEndDate` | string | `YYYY-MM-DD` — Saturday of that week |
| `revenue` | number | Total income that week (₹) |
| `expenses` | number | Total expenses that week (₹) |
| `newClients` | number | New clients added |
| `overdueCount` | number | Overdue invoices at week end |
| `avgDaysToPayment` | number | Mean days from invoice issue to payment |

## Public Datasets Used for Validation

The synthetic data was cross-validated against three public datasets to ensure realism:

### 1. IBM Finance Factoring — Late Payment Histories
- **Source:** Kaggle — `kaggle.com/datasets/hhenry/finance-factoring-ibm-late-payment-histories`
- **What it is:** Real accounts receivable data with invoice dates, due dates, and actual payment dates from B2B transactions
- **How we used it:** Confirmed that 3 late payments out of 4 invoices is a realistic signal for HIGH-risk client classification. Validated our risk score formula thresholds (score ≥ 60 = HIGH).
- **License:** Public / Kaggle Open

### 2. UCI Online Retail II
- **Source:** `archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii`
- **What it is:** 1M+ real wholesale transactions from a UK SME (2009–2011). Columns: InvoiceNo, InvoiceDate, CustomerID, Quantity, UnitPrice.
- **How we used it:** Validated that weekly sales of ₹30,000–₹1,05,000 are realistic for a wholesale SME at this scale (converted from GBP). Confirmed that 3–5 clients account for most revenue.
- **License:** CC BY 4.0

### 3. World Bank MSME Country Indicators
- **Source:** Kaggle — `kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/msme-country-indicators-and-sources`
- **What it is:** Macro-level data on MSME financial health, payment delays, and cost structures across countries including India.
- **How we used it:** Confirmed that salaries + logistics = ~70% of operating costs is realistic for Indian SMEs. Confirmed that 4–6 week payment delays are common in the sector.
- **License:** World Bank Open Data License

## Runtime Integration of Validation References

CashGuardian now stores short validation notes in:

- `data/externalValidation.json`

At runtime, these notes are injected into the AI system prompt as context. This helps the model stay aligned with realistic payment behavior and SME cost patterns while still using the locked local business data as the single source of truth for calculations.

---

## Why not use a public dataset directly?

Public datasets don't have:
- Indian Rupee (₹) amounts at SME scale
- Named Indian clients (Sharma Retail, Gupta Enterprises, etc.)
- Invoice-level detail paired with transaction records
- Deliberately seeded anomalies to test detection

The synthetic approach lets us **design for all features** while still being **grounded in real patterns** via the validation above.

---

## Schema rules (enforced by AGENTS.md)

1. Never modify these files — they are benchmark-locked
2. All amounts are positive integers in Indian Rupees
3. All dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings (not Date objects)
4. `paymentHistory` is always an array (empty `[]` if no payments)
5. `client` in transactions is `null` for expense records, never an empty string
