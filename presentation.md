# CashGuardian — Presentation

## Problem Statement

> *[Visual: Blank terminal or cluttered spreadsheet on screen]*

"Imagine you're running a business. It's the end of the month and you need answers fast.
How much cash do I actually have? Which clients owe me money? Are my expenses spiking?

But instead of getting answers, you're stuck inside spreadsheets, complex BI dashboards, and finance tools that take hours to learn and seconds to confuse you.

This is the reality for most founders and operators today — and it's not a data problem. It's a **communication** problem.

**Introducing CashGuardian** — Talk to your business finances in plain English."

## Segment 2 — Problem Deep Dive
**Timing: [0:45 – 1:15]**

> *[Visual: Problem Statement Pillars]*

| Pillar | Challenge Faced by SMEs | CashGuardian Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Clarity** | BI tools speak jargon. Founders need plain answers. | Plain-English AI narratives with `summaryService`. |
| **Trust** | AI-generated numbers can hallucinate. | Grounded reasoning using locked transactional data. |
| **Speed** | Waiting minutes for dashboards to load kills momentum. | Deterministic services layer returning in <2ms. |

"The core challenges teams face are Clarity, Trust, and Speed. CashGuardian was built specifically to solve these three friction points by bridge deterministic financial logic with generative AI narratives."
