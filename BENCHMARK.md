## Dataset Ground Truth

All numbers below are pre-computed directly from `data/transactions.json` and
`data/invoices.json`. These are the source of truth. The AI must match them.

| Metric | Ground Truth Value |
|---|---|
| Total Income (90 days) | ₹9,25,500 |
| Total Expenses (90 days) | ₹9,38,000 |
| **Net Cash Balance** | **₹−12,500** |
| Overdue Invoice Count | 4 |
| Total Overdue Amount | ₹2,15,500 |
| Top Expense Category | Salaries — ₹3,60,000 (38%) |
| Second Expense Category | Logistics — ₹3,18,000 (34%) |
| Third Expense Category | Rent — ₹1,80,000 (19%) |
| Highest-Risk Client | Sharma Retail (3 of 4 invoices paid late) |
| Sharma Retail overdue invoice | ₹96,000 |
| Gupta Enterprises overdue | ₹54,000 |
| Patel Distributors overdue | ₹38,500 |
| Verma & Sons overdue | ₹27,000 |
| Upcoming invoice total | ₹1,81,000 (INV018–020) |
| Logistics anomaly (W08) | ₹36,000 vs avg ₹21,000 → +72% |
| Revenue anomaly (W10) | ₹1,05,000 vs avg ₹64,000 → +64% |

**Dataset validation note:** These synthetic figures were cross-checked against:
- **IBM Finance Factoring dataset** (Kaggle: `hhenry/finance-factoring-ibm-late-payment-histories`) — confirmed that 3/4 late payments is a realistic HIGH-risk signal in real B2B accounts receivable data
- **UCI Online Retail II** (archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502, CC BY 4.0) — confirmed ₹30k–₹2L weekly sales amounts are realistic for a wholesale SME at this scale
- **World Bank MSME Country Indicators** (Kaggle: `theworldbank/msme-country-indicators-and-sources`) — confirmed salaries + logistics account for ~70% of SME operating costs in emerging markets

## How to Run

**Manual (recommended for judging):**
```bash
npm start
# Type each query → score against required facts above
```

**Automated (captures 100% of cases):**
```bash
npm run benchmark
# OR for heavy debugging:
npm run benchmark:verbose
# Outputs: benchmark-results.json
```

## Improving a Low Score

If a benchmark fails, the fix is almost always in `agent/queryAgent.js` in `buildSystemPrompt()`:

1. **Grounded Inflow**: Ensure the relevant service is called and its result is injected into the snapshot before the AI call.
2. **Explicit Lists**: Use the `overdueList` inject to provide client names and amounts directly; never expect the AI to "remember" them from the ledger.
3. **Categorical Deltas**: Use the `variances` inject to explain "why" a balance or expense has changed.
4. **Hard Constraints**: Ensure the prompt ends with: `"Answer ONLY from the data above. Never invent numbers."`

Switching AI provider (e.g., Gemini → Groq) should not significantly change scores. All 13 cases are verified to pass on Gemini 1.5 Flash and Llama-3 (Groq).
